    "Q1. Contingency Matrix in Classification Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A contingency matrix, also known as a confusion matrix, is a table that describes the performance of a classification model by comparing predicted and actual classes.\n",
    "It has rows representing the actual classes and columns representing the predicted classes.\n",
    "Each cell of the matrix contains the count of instances that belong to a specific combination of actual and predicted classes.\n",
    "The matrix helps visualize the model's performance in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.\n",
    "Q2. Pair Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "A pair confusion matrix is an extension of the regular confusion matrix used in multi-label classification tasks.\n",
    "In pair confusion matrices, rows and columns correspond to pairs of true and predicted labels instead of individual classes.\n",
    "It is useful in scenarios where the focus is on pairwise relationships between labels rather than individual class performance.\n",
    "Q3. Extrinsic Measure in NLP:\n",
    "\n",
    "In natural language processing (NLP), an extrinsic measure evaluates the performance of a language model by considering its impact on downstream tasks or applications.\n",
    "It involves integrating the language model into a specific application or task and measuring its effectiveness in improving task performance, such as accuracy or efficiency.\n",
    "Q4. Intrinsic Measure in Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to extrinsic measures, intrinsic measures evaluate the performance of machine learning models based on their internal characteristics or properties.\n",
    "These measures assess aspects such as model complexity, generalization ability, or convergence behavior.\n",
    "They are often used during model development and optimization to guide algorithm selection or hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "Q5. Purpose of Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "A confusion matrix provides detailed information about the performance of a classification model, including true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.\n",
    "It helps identify strengths and weaknesses of the model by revealing common types of prediction errors, such as misclassifications and confusion between similar classes.\n",
    "By analyzing the confusion matrix, model adjustments can be made to improve performance, such as adjusting decision thresholds or addressing class imbalances.\n",
    "Q6. Common Intrinsic Measures in Unsupervised Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Intrinsic measures in unsupervised learning assess the quality of learned representations or clusters without external labels.\n",
    "Examples include clustering metrics like silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, and Calinski-Harabasz index.\n",
    "These measures provide insights into the compactness, separation, and overall structure of clusters generated by unsupervised algorithms.\n",
    "Q7. Limitations of Accuracy as Sole Metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy alone may be misleading, especially in imbalanced datasets where the majority class dominates.\n",
    "It does not provide insights into specific types of errors made by the model.\n",
    "Other metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) offer a more nuanced evaluation, particularly for tasks with class imbalance or differing misclassification costs.\n",
